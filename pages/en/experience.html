                        <p>I worked as a junior software developer at a company called Atik Nakit for 14 months. During this time, I actively worked on both the front-end and back-end development of the company's website and panel screens. I developed user-friendly and interactive interfaces using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. Additionally, I provided solutions for SQL database management and back-end operations.
                            I also developed projects in the field of artificial intelligence. I trained and integrated artificial intelligence models using Colab and Ultralytics Hub platforms. In these projects, I was involved in many stages such as data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluations.
                            The experiences I gained and the new technologies I learned during this process increased my competencies in the field of software development and greatly contributed to my professional development.<br><br>★★★★★</p>
