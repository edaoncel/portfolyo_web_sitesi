                        <h1>ACADEMIC CHRONOLOGY</h1>
                            <p>I am Eda Öncel, a graduate of Hacı Ethem Şerife Kavukçu Anatolian High School. My interest in science and technology during high school merged with my passion for the software world after starting university. I studied Management Information Systems (MIS) at Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, where I developed myself in both IT and management courses.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my university life, I worked diligently and with a success-oriented approach as a student. In my academic career, I had the opportunity to develop myself with technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. By applying the theoretical knowledge I learned in these projects in practice, I had the chance to better understand the dynamics of software development processes.</p>
                            <p>My interest and curiosity in software were not limited to university education. My enthusiasm for continuous learning and self-improvement carried me further. The knowledge and experiences I gained during my university life greatly contributed to both my personal and professional development. By rediscovering my passion and excitement for this field every day, I continue to produce creative solutions in the software world.</p>
